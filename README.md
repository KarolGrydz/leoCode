# Leocode

Simple search engine by name

Notes:

- styles are made for desktop only (1440px)
- we could do it on props alone, without using context

Possible things to add in the future:

- for a larger application, a style library (MaterialUI ?)
- e2e tests
- maybe redux if the application grew a lot
- use of translations for other nationalities (i18next?)
